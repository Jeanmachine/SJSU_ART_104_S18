Online Game communities are social in nature, by Cindy Ahuna 2005

The article begins with the author covering a brief summary of multiplayer gaming. She begins with SpaceWar and PLATO and continues until 2001’s MMO, Everquest. Everquest was a massive game for the time, boasting 360,000 concurrent subscribers at one point. This game allowed people to anonymously swap genders, more often to female because female characters were treated better. More importantly, social communities evolved from online gaming communities. Guilds in everquests are a great example, as well as the conventions that are held in real life. Many gamers developed friendships over these games while utilizing the ingame chat system. 
After reading the article I can definitely say that online gaming communities today are nearly the same as before. They are still a social platform where people can coexist and interact with one another in virtual environments. It’s also evolved to the point where we now have ESports, simply massive worldwide competitive gaming. Games like league of legends and DOTA 2 have massive tournaments where players from around the world compete to win millions of dollars. These competitions are usually held in large stadiums where tens of thousands of people attend and hundreds of thousands view live online. The social aspect of online gaming communities has definitely blown up since the time of this article.
