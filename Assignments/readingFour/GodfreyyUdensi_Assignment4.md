Towards a Poetics of Artificial Super Intelligence 

The article talks about the emergence of Artificial intelligence and possible events realities that would be present when AI is fully established. The author tells us how  ASI will function in ways we can’t and won’t understand, but it won’t necessarily be unfriendly. Friendly, unfriendly, moral and immoral — these concepts won’t apply. An ASI would be motivated by interpretations of the world within cognitive frameworks that we can’t access. 
The author also compares AI with aliens and this comparison is valid because artificial intelligence is its own life form when you begin to think about it. Artificial intelligence is closer to us than we know and it is getting more ubiquitous as the times go by. As a result of this we are adapting more and more to AI just as a plant adapts to light. 
AI also indirectly offers us insight into the future by giving us a sense of what is possible as we steadily adapt to them. A potential disaster is when we start anthropomorphizing AI because it encourages unrealistic expectations.
The author goes ahead to talk about the terms and metaphors commonly used in the AI world:
•	Hurricane: A fully mature ASI is comparable to a hurricane in the sense that it is overwhelming, massive and forceful like a typical hurricane. It is not double minded about its destructive abilities because it is indiferrent to human intervention
It adjusts, creating and manipulating scenarios in which its specialised goal system can find completion. It remains on the horizon, at a distance from humankind, consuming energy and resources, morphing according to its own unpredictable logic. It might approach the city, it might not. A human observes the hurricane of ASI, which can only be prepared for, charted, tracked.
