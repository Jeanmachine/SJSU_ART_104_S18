Assignment:2

Artificial Intelligence is one of the massive things happening right now when it comes to modern technology in America. So far Artificial 
Intelligence has gotten so advanced that there is an A.I. by the name of Sophia who is a first citizen A.I. of Saudi Arabi. This 
technology goes to show who advance A.I. is becoming, and the article from the website Switch called Artificial Love Life is a Real as 
the Real Thing by Professor S. Farsad, she goes to question whether artificial life or A.I. can romantically have feelings for another 
artificial life and love like humans can.  She goes to talk about how knowing this information is very important because if humans are
going to go and produce more artificial life forms and if they could love as people do would they reproduce a lot quicker especially if 
they can love as humans do romantically. This article relevance to today life makes a statement about this modern technology because how 
far advanced we are when it comes to this topic.  We already have an A.I. who is a citizen and who say wants to make a family, which goes 
to show Sophia the A.I. wants a significant other. 

Another reason why this topic is an important question because we are continuing to use A.I. in everyday life whether that be using a 
Google device or Echo the device from Amazon. There is a growing industry with artificial intelligence and with knowing that we need to 
know how advanced these creations are becoming. A recent article about Facebook had an experiment on A.I. and had to shut the experiment 
down because the two A.I. were talking to each other in another language they made up on their own. .  Now that is some technology that 
we are developing if two robots started to talk in another language and nobody knows why these two robots decided that talking to each 
other in a language that no one else knows was something they felt they needed to do. It makes you question what was the A.I. felt they 
needed to keep to themselves? What secrets did they try to keep from the people? So, this article by Professor S. Farsad about knowing if 
the artificial life can love because if they can, then it could be a problem if they can reproduce also.  

In the article, Professor S. Farsad explains how she comes up with her experiment without using artificial life but using actual people. 
She had them go through seven step to compare with how an artificial life would possibly fall in love and whether people would fall in 
love by doing the steps, but the conclusion shows that the woman in the experiment did fall in love and the man did not fill the same. 
Using this information was going to help her determine if the A.I. could go through the same steps and if it could come true, but she 
states that she would have to continue to pursue the research.
