Identify yourself by Krystal South was surprisingly very informative. She talked about a broad range of topics, from identity to branding to just about 
anything bordering on identity.
I appreciated the knowledge I gained about computers in relation to emotions. According to her, computers should not be allowed to make important decisions
because they lack human emotions. I totally agree with this and it ties in with my statement in class when I went agaimst the motion that 
America should fully embrace driverless cars. 
Another eye opening paragragh in this reading was the part where she explained how the internet has transformed our societal structure and also 
our internal structure. The fact that we spend so much time in front of an inanimate machine like a phone or computer, has made our lives 
intertwined with the internet. On the brighter side, the internet has improved humanity by fostering accessibility to information and enhancing 
human creativity and collaboration.
Branding in the past was measured by sales and stock value, now it is measured in social analytics and web metrics.
