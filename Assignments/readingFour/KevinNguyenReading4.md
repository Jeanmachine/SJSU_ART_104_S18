This article, “Towards a Poetics of Artificial Superintelligence,” written by Nora N. Khan, the author talks about the potential future of 
AI. She discusses ASI, artificial superintellegence, which ive never heard about. ASI are more capable and exceeds the race of man kind in 
various fields. They have great problem solving skills and abstract reasoning. ASI functions in complicated ways that we will not 
understand. To me, that’s a bit scary since we are not able to cope on their level. What is more scary is that these ASI’s are not human 
and more like aliens. These aliens that are smarter than us and we cant understand how they work. What if something goes wrong and we cant 
help fix them since they are on another dimension of intelligence. I was not really interested in AI nor really read up or heard much 
about of the subject. After reading this article, I had a question as to why we need Artificial Intelligence? I have a thought that they 
will help us with solving problems and work for us since they are great learners. But how bad do we need them?
