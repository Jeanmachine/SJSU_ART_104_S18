Assignment 04
 
 
 The article “Towards a Poetics of Artificial Superintelligence” is about an artificial superintelligence that has unlimited access to 
the knowledge and skills it contains. If the world was one day ruled by a super artificial intelligence and the human race was just 
the bystander to what they are doing. First off, the thought of a superintelligence machine that could do everything a regular human 
can do is giving that creation too much power, but if the world was infested with artificial intelligence walking around like regular 
people, there could be a possibility that the human race could be taken over. The article talks about a philosopher by the name of Nick 
Bostrom, who wrote a book called Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies Which cover on what the future could look like if an 
intelligent entity comes to be and the possibilities of what it could look like in the future. Bostrom also writes about how having this 
artificial intelligence could become smarter, which could start problems socially and politically that could, in the long run, cause a 
fallout between artificial intelligence and humans. The article also talks about how having artificial intelligence can and might be 
dangerous to the human race. 
  Artificial intelligence could be dangerous because an AI doesn’t have the empathy that a human has, which shapes the way we make our 
decisions in life and how we choose to reach our goals. With an AI they would make a decision that is made accordingly to what gives 
them the best results at the end regardless of who it could hurt to make that decision. Although artificial intelligence could help 
humans make certain decisions on some important issues because AI has the capabilities of thinking faster and concluding a lot quicker 
could have the AI thinking that it is more superior than humans and once they start thinking that, they will start making decisions 
without the human consent. With all the help an artificial intelligence could do to help humanity with all the comprehension, data, 
and knowledge they have, it could easily backfire, and an AI could easily use all of that knowledge for their agenda. The article 
overall discusses how having artificial intelligence can change the world with so many possibilities, but it also criticizes artificial 
intelligence too by not knowing what they will do without the consent of humans and it bot scars people and excites them at the same 
time. The world is heading towards AI, but it might not develop as big as we imagine it could get.
