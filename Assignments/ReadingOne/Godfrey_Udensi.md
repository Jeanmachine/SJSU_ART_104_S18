ON GREEN TECHNOLOGY by Julia Butterfly

The author gives a synopsis about green technology in relation to humanity. Human progress is now measured in terms of units of production as opposed to being measured by a connection to one anotherand the earth. She calls it the disconnected consciousness.

I agree with her opinion that the human species is heading to a possible extinction as a result of this. Personally when I look at the world today and the advent of social media, I can see the huge dent it has created in human society. The disconnect between humanity has been worsened by it and even silicon valley executives in recent times have admitted to the fact that todays technology is doing our kids more harm than good. The author suggests that creativity is one way we can reclaim our human potential. Utlizing the green movement by using green concepts in an out of the box manner is all creativity is about. Creativity done through a connected cosciousness, will produce tremendous results and in the end will strenghten us all.

Green simply means that we're not separate from the earth, rather to remember that we come from the earth and return to it.
