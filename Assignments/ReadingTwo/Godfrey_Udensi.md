An Introduction to Virtual reality by Leda Kanellakos

The author defined virtual reality  Virtual as an electronic simulation of environments experienced via head mounted eye goggles and 
wired clothing enabling the end user to interact in realistic three-dimensional situations. Virtual reality can be compared to the 
introduction of the television in the 1940s. When it came out it was more advanced less popular than the radio. Most people believed it 
wasn't here to stay but it eventually did. Scientists predict that when the technology matures, it will amount to more than 60% of the market.
Virtual reality is based on telepresence and it depends on the perceiver who utilizes sophisticated goggles and body movements. It is a medium for the extension of the body and mind.
One of the benefits it has according to the author is telepresence, the ability to be somewhere even though not physically. It gives users the freedom of expression possible in real life 
interactions.

One of the potential drawbacks of this technology is that it encourages deception. Users have the opportunity to design themselves in ways that don't 
represent who they are in real life. This could lead to further complications. Virtual reality cannot bring a new reality into our world because
our innate biological needs cannot be replaced by a computerized fantasy. According to the author, over 3million years of human evolution cannot
be replaced by a keystroke.
