Assignment 1

The articles that I choose to read was Cracking the Maze Online Exhibit Game Plug-ins and Patches as Hacker Art, New Media in Academia, 
and America the ultimate killer app. The article on America the Ultimate Killer App was an interesting article to read it reminded me 
about a tv show that a watch called Black Mirror because the article talked about how America is just a brand that markets themselves
to be better and how you can live so much better if you live in America. It also writes about how big moments that have happened in 
America could be staged for some reason for the government to bring in more modern technology or to have some new law pass. The journal 
reminded me of the tv show Black Mirror because in that show it shows what could happen when technology progresses to the point where the 
government can trick their people to see what they want you to see and think what they want you to think by erasing your memory and 
planting additional information in it. . It also about what could happen when technology is to advance for us. Another article called 
New Media in Academia was about the new media in art education and how there are two diverse types of education when it comes to models. 
You have your studio model where the student chooses to do what he or she wants and is responsible for making the time to get it done with 
lectures, workshops, and shared critiques. Then you have the classroom model where the student is given the assignment from the teacher, 
and they have to do what the teacher wants. The article was interesting because you can either learn in a classroom setting or a studio 
setting and either way you will get the tools you need in order to do what you want in your future. The last article I read was the 
Cracking the Maze Online Exhibit Game Plug-ins and Patches as Hacker Art this was an interesting read because it went over how software 
and coding can fix a bug. About the people who fix games or computer systems and how computer coding and game coding are different with 
the way, they fix their programs.  All together the three articles that I read, I liked America the Ultimate Killer app the best because 
it caught my attention and had me thinking about the big events that have happened in America.If it is planned for another event that the 
government wanted to introduce to America for their benefit in the long run, but it kept me the most engaged.
