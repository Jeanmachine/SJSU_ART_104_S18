Choosing an article from the switch archives, I selected an interview because I felt that a conversation would be engaging and easier to read in the dense format of the switch website. The article I chose was an interview between Shelia Malone speaking for Switch and Christine Paul, a curator of new media works for Whitney. They discussed the difference in how new media is displayed different parts of the world, American and European communities specifically. Switch first asked several questions about what collaboration is like in new media projects, to which Paul responded that she had participated in collaborations several times before and that and that she considers collaboration essential to the production and display of new media. They further discussed the definition of collaboration. After that the conversation shifted alternately between questions on Paul's personal thoughts on new media art and an actual comparison of the strengths and weaknesses of each region's appoach to new media art.
