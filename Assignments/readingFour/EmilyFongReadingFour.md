<hr />
<p>The article discusses what AI could be in the future. The author calls fully functional AI to be ASI (Artificial Superintelligence). There is clear encouragement to view ASI as a friendly tool instead of the grim portrayal often shown in media. We need to think of ASI as an alien because they are not human nor think like us. Although they will exceed capabilities of human thinking, we should not view them as a danger. The potential of using ASI can lead to roles that make our society more functional. The author describes several metaphors of potential ASI in the future. One example is the hurricane ASI, which is a term of how destructive an ASI can be. Hopefully, we do not have these encounters. Another example is the architect, an ASI that can build and sculpt physical and cognitive structures. These ASI are very practical and I can see them abundant in our future. The sovereign ASI is an interesting concept. It is an ASI that cannot be influence while operating on long-term objectives. They can judge and solve world problems in our society. I believe it is unavoidable that AI will evolve beyond what it is now. As technology evolve so does a birth of new thinking beings created by humans.</p>
