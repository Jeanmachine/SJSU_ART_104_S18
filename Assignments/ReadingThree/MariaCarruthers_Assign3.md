The article I read was Identify Yourself, and it starts off by talking about artificial intelligence and how even though they are amazing 
inventions, we should never leave an artificial intelligence to make important decisions for us human beings. That’s because artificial 
intelligent robots are not capable of making human judgments since a robot is all about making decisions based on the quickest or most 
efficient decision.  It also talks about how technology has shaped the world from social media to having information and resources at our 
fingertips at such a speed, that we now hunger for quick information. 

I feel that technology has changed the way people communicate and just everyday life. People now rely on technology for almost everything 
these days. For instance, some people wouldn’t even know how to get to one place using a regular map like how people had to get around. 
Now people need their GPS to get anywhere or else they’d get lost. Another example is when people do whatever they need to do to stay in 
touch with their social media and are always on their phones. It is even difficult for people to have a regular conversation now and days 
then it is for them to instant message you. The article also talks about how technology has made everyone impatient with everything, and 
I would have to agree to that because I have seen people get so mad just for waiting for five minutes at the grocery store. Whether that 
be them waiting in line to check out or at the meat counter waiting for help, I see some people completely freak out, and that shows what 
technology is doing to almost every generation. 

Reading this article shade light on how our posture is changing changed by being hunched over the computer for hours on end and how our 
bodies are on an alert system like we are programmed.  Waiting for the next alert on our phones to keep us engaged with the screen.  It 
is true in a way staying connected to the internet for a long time and having your phone on you where ever you go, does make you start 
to look forward to that next notification to be connected with our internet selves. This article was overall interesting because it opened 
my eyes to how technology is shaping us and made me more aware of how I should be spending my time and that’s not being online all the 
time.
