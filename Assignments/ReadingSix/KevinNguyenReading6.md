The article, â€œInvisible Images (Your Pictures Are Looking at You), written by Trevor Paglen, talks mostly about how images today are made 
by machines for other machines and how our eyes see them on a screen is completely different from viewing a photograph. Nowadays, most of 
us take photos with our phones and view them on screen. The LCD screen emits light at frequencies where our eyes see the colors and 
densities as shapes. These photos are only available to us when we turn on the phone and pull up an application to view the images. These 
images are only view able for short periods of time. These machine readable files are also subject to many implications. Facebook 
recognizes photos with people in them and pull facial data for their database. They have a tool that easily tag others in a group photo by 
using facial recognition. The facial recognition program matches faces with the ones on the persons profile and the one on the group 
picture. It will identify their name as well. Its quite creepy and annoying in my opinion. Sometimes Facebook does this automatically and 
some people don't want their photos tagged.Its crazy to see how we are being watched under surveillance from many places and groups. Our 
information is being passed around from machine to machine to either learn about our behavior to better suit the needs of business or to 
keep a security. I do feel like I am being taken advantage of and feared when my identity is used for surveying or stored to a database 
for others to use since they do not have my consent. I feel as if most of this information is mainly useful toward AI. Data of images, 
behavior, emotions, races, genders, and places that humans interact in are what AI needs to learn. By using the machine readable files, 
the information they pull from us is useful towards in many areas including AI.
