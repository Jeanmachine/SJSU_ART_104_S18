Invisible Images (Your Pictures Are Looking at You) by Trevor Paglen

This was an interesting expose about images and their effect on us today in a technological context. I really have never seen the topic of images through 
these lens before and I consider it amazing and eye opening. Normally when I hear about images, my mind goes to a picture either a physical
one or one in a screen. According to Paglen, images started out as physical but then evolved to electronic elements and light with the advent
of technological advancements. Analysis of visual culture initially included representation, spectacle, meaning and mimesis (imitation) but 
eventually evolved to become more machine oriented and based on invisible qualities. While reading this article it was hard to grasp the concept of
images watching us but as I read on it made sense. 

It all starts with the basic idea that digital images are unique in the sense that they're  machine-readable and can only be seen briefly by
humans. Thinking deeper about this concept I discovered its validity because when I look at a picture in my phone I'm really not looking at an
actual drawing but I'm actually looking at a machine readable coded file that my phone screen brought to life. I was also surprised to learn about
ALPR (Automatic License Plate Readers) as I never knew they were used or could be used by any one other than a law enforcement officer. Its really
sickening to realize that the general populace is constantly being exploited. I say that because the article informs us how Vivid solutions
has been given a contract to take random pictures of every and any car they come across on the road. So my major concern is: "Is it wrong 
to tell Americans of this development?" Why should the average American not be aware of this?

The invisible visual culture is not just restricted to the above but also extends to the human-to-human context. The advent of social media has 
put billions of pictures on the internet and AI has taken advantage of this human visual culture and transformed it into a massive flexible 
training set.
