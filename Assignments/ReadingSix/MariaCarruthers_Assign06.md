Invisible Images (Your Pictures are looking at you)
Reading #6
	Reading six is called Invisible Images (Your Pictures Are looking at You), and it starts off talking about how our visual culture has 
  changed as time has progressed. The fact that now when we see an image, it is most of the time taken from a machine. A machine is making 
  an image for another machine to make for our eyes to see. It is like a camera being used to take a beautiful photo of scenery or a 
  moment and developed by a computer for others to look see the moment too. The process sounds like what Instagram is all about and 
  because of the majority of people or either using some type of social media like Facebook or Instagram we are losing touch with what 
  is real. What we are looking at is machine readable photos, a photograph shot by your cell phone and the image on the phone is only 
  temporary to the human eye because it reverts to a machine again once the phone is turned off. The reading also talks about how our 
  environment and our everyday life is filled with the machine to machine coding from and ALPR to an OCR these cameras are used all the 
  time for different reasons and how it is next generation surveillance. 
  
  The reading also goes on about how all computers have a mathematical abstraction from the image that they are looking at. The 
  recognition of how a computer depends on the software it is using it will take someone’s face to analyze it and then start subtracting 
  the features that someone has in common with other people’s faces. That will help leave a one of a kind facial fingerprint to recognize 
  a certain person. The article also explains “how producers have made interventions on a human to human visual culture and that produces 
  forms of the counterculture to make claims, to assert rights, and to expand the field of represented peoples and positions in visual 
  culture.” Some artists are getting the help of cultural workers and attempting to challenge the machine’s vision system by developing 
  a form of vision that is legible to the human eye but is also illegible to the machine’s vision. The thought of all this is a little 
  interesting, but also I do not see the significant in it all.
