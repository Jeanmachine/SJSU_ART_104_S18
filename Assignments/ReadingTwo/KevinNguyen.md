	“Pretend to Be a Bot, Rehumanize the Web,” is an interview with web developer and teacher, Sebastian Schieg held by Studio Berlin. 
  Sebastian talks about the freelance job listing website called, Fiverr.com, a site in which people can post up gigs and offer services 
  for a small fee; usually $5. His main idea of this interview was about  digital labor and how the entrepreneurs online are software 
  extensions. Sebastian was intrigued by a story of how Donald Trump’s team hired a Singaporean teenager to convert a PowerPoint 
  presentation into a Prezi through Fiverr.com. The laborer was a 15 year old girl which took her less than a day to complete the job. 
  Sebastian saw this and made a piece called, “I Will Say Whatever You Want in Front of a Pizza,” which is also made with a Prezi. It is a 
  presentation of a narrated story from the perspective of an internet worker. Sebastian wanted to get the idea across as how digital 
  workers are software extensions. As software extensions, digital workers are using their mind and body into the extended computational 
  work. 

I was very surprised to read a story about the website, Fiverr.com because ive had past experience with it. In the past, I have actually 
made an account before to offer my video editing services and look for gigs to make some money. Fiverr.com had an app advertisement I 
stumbled on from some where. It was not a website I've heard of before or thought existed. The site seemed sketchy at first because of the 
way it looked to me but at the time I was looking for quick money so I decided to create an account. However, looking through the 
gigs,services, competitors, and labor rates; I felt like I was undercutting myself for the amount of work I’d do for five dollars. I 
decided not to do any work from this website and deleted my account. After reading through this article, the name “Cloud Worker,” stood 
out to me because that’s what I would've been if I went through with the Fiverr gigs. I never thought about it like that. 

I also agree with him that social networks like Google and Facebook should and should not pay us for labor. For example, every time I 
visit a new restaurant, Google would send me a notification on my phone to ask me to answer some questions for their Google Review and 
Maps information. The questions they ask me relates to parking, environment, ambiance, good for kids, and rating. I expect that they would 
use this information to update the business’ listing on their Google services. In this area, I would expect them to pay us. On the other 
hand, we are also using their services as well so it plays out..
