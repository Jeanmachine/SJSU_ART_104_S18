In Paglen's article "Invisible Images" he talks about how that because machines have been the ones recently to create images that it has
caused the human eye to not be able to recognize the details in the images such as the color satuartion and other features images have that
are normally visible to the naked eye. The tide has turned to where he belives that instead of us looking at the image it in turn looks back
at us.But he has forgotten the humans have evolved to these type of changes since the beginning of our exsistence. Animals have adapted to
their envoirnment when things suddenly change and they passed those traits on to the next generation what's to say that humans are not 
capable of doing the same thing?

Yes it is true that technology has gotten so advance that they are able to take images and make so crystal clear and add so many pixels to 
them that it is hard to believe that it's only an image. I get this same feeling when you watch a movie in 4K or regular HD the difference has
been staggering. But there are some times in certain films where it looks no different to me at all. It all varies on how it was filmed and
what way the film makers beleive is the best viewing set up for those to truly be able to embarce and get sucked into the movie's setting.
TV's have always evolved whether they end up being curved or the resolution gets upgraded every few years and with that so do the people's
vision so that they can adapt/evolve to the new changes so they can embrace the changes that were made. 

Overall, I think there is nothing to worry about. Humans have been able to survive harsh weather conditions in the past and have adapted those 
kinds of situations. This is no different in fact it is much less frightining in comparision. Technology will always continue to eveolve as time
goes on, with that, humans will follow suit making sure they learn from the past and adjust themselves to how the world is changing around them.
This cycle will continue for many years to come and many new things will change from the way we live our lives now whether it be from how we watch 
shows and movies to our transportation methods and even the way we may consume our own meals.
