Hito Steryl is asked a question on the shortcomings of thinking in representational terms today and how we can profitably transition to a 
post-representational paradigm of art practices. The analogy she gives Marvin Jordan is quite striking, impressive and is also a suitable
answer to the question asked. The phone camera technology revealed here is one I am not accustomed to. A phone camera that works not only
with the present but also with the past. It creates pictures from earlier pictures using noise as a foundation.

I totally agree with her that representative politics works the same way. I say that because ideal democracy tells us that we decide who
leads us in a political capacity.

Referring to how the behavior of people is affected by visual culture, twitter bots come to mind because they are a huge factor in politics.
They are constantly used to propagate political agenda and all other types of agenda. They are also used for PR and branding. The author refers
to how twitter bots ae usually masked with pictures of famous celebrities and even porn actors.

As per the trend/shift involving the shift from representation to participation, we can see this clearly in social media over the years.
Users of social media went from just having facebook friends and communicating with friends to actively participating in the distribution of
images, videos and even literature without even knowing it.

The topic of mass surveillance in the context of cell-phone cameras and social media has been a mini passion for me especially as a student.
I have always been amazed at the fact that we as consumers are not bothered that we are being surveilled. Despite all the revelations about
mass government surveillance and the rest, we still continually put ourselves out there. I agreee to an extent with Hito Steryl on the notion
that people love algorithmic ignorance.
