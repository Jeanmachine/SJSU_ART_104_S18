The Switch article I chose was Issue 28: Biohacking by Sara Gevurtz. The title stood out to me about what it means to biohack something. In this article, there is a new hackerspace called Biocurious in Silicon which is a space where you can experiment with biology. It is a movement that aims to educate people on do-it-yourself biology as a hobby. For example, people can learn biology of plants to efficiently grow their own food.

The author talks about her own experiences attending the first few Biocurious workshops. For the first one, she learned to create her own biosphere. I thought that was pretty neat and would make a nice decoration to take home. The biosphere is a self-contained ecosystem encased in a jar or some sealed object. The second workshop involved growing your own bacteria. I have done this before when I took biology in high school so for newcomers, this would be an exciting lab. I think the space is a great idea for scientists and artist to collaborate together. Lab equipment for science experiments is accessible to the public and allows an opportunity for people to grow their interest in biology.
