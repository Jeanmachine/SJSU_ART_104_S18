  Our concept revolves around the psychological and cognitive effects that VR might have on people; specifically cartoony avatars versus realistic characters and how this distinction affects empathy and the user's mentality. For example, we can use VR as a therapy tool to treat traumas/phobias and mental illness or distract from treatment (ie) distracting kids from taking their shots so it's a smoother experience. 
  
  We might present it in an interactive website or a first person short film because we want to emphasize an experiential interaction over the straightforward reading of an essay. (aframe or 3js)
