In the right column of the article, “Identify Yourself” by Krystal South, the author talks about how the internet and technology had taken 
over her life. Surprisingly, her life being the internet itself makes me realize that I am the same as her. Everything she does and how 
she lives revolves and depends on the internet and technology; more specifically the smart phones. Every decision is not based on self 
conscious anymore but Google. Any question can be answered easily without effort or manual labor. 
In the article, she archives her life on the internet such as posting photos on Flickr, blogged in various sites, and uploaded to Vimeo. 
She then develops a community of followers that shows interest in her content. The author feels a connection with the content she puts 
out from her life to her followers who are getting a steady stream of content. The author is sort of creating a brand or legacy for 
herself that will overlast her lifetime. It just all depends if someone will look for it or if it will mean anything to them when they 
find it. This relates to me very much when I got into online social media and photography. I had a Tumblr account where I would post 
photos frequently  and blog about my day or event. My friends and followers were able to like and repost my posts and each time I had a 
reaction to a post, it made me feel like they were enjoying my content. So my Tumblr blog became a daily routine for me and became a 
platform for me to show other people what I do with my life. Even though most of my followers are my friends at school, they still read 
and view my posts. Some followers are out of the country and I have built a connection with them through similar interests. It felt 
like it was a job to inform the world what I was doing. It was crazy for me to think that I spent more time on the internet talking to 
others than in person..
