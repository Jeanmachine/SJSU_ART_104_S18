In Berger's Way of Seeing he covers 4 different topics including they way people see art, how woman were protrayed,how realistic people 
were painted and advertising and their relation to oil painting. These ideas he discusses were based on the 70's but some of those ideas
still have value even in present day. The biggest idea that he talks about is the idea of how we see art in museums and how mass production
has taken away from the value of the piece. When I see certain artworks, they can catch my eye from even half way across the hall. If a
artwork can do that it says a lot about how the piece was designed. What did the artist do to help catch your attention was it the use of
colors? The main subject? Did he/she achieve their goal when they picked this design choice? I beleive they did.

When he talked about mass reproduction of the art work, he believed that it causes the value of the piece to go down. I agree with him to some 
degree. It's true that if someone can access an image of the artwork anytime anywhere there could be no reason or desire to go and visit
the original because it could be very costly to make arrangements to plan a trip to visit the piece. However there is a difference from an
image of the piece and the real deal. By seeing the original you can notice more details that are not normally seen in the photos. For example,
you can notice the artists' brush strokes or the better details of the colors and shadows in the piece and possible changes/adjustments 
they may have made during the making of the piece. Photos take away the magic that the real deal creates and that is something that has hold
truth since the creation of photography.

In regards to the way women were portrayed during these times when the paintings were made, they were seen as being perfect with nice curvature
whether or not they are thin or slightly heavy. The male artist's saw them as having a glow in thier skin or their nicely shaped breasts almost 
as if they were their ideal dream woman that would want to marry one day. When pieces like this were made their was no issues or debates 
that occured if the piece was over sexualized. Now that is something that can be addressed or thought of while looking at a piece. Because of 
the change in the times, artists have to have a reasonable explanation in to why they made the this design choice which is a shame because
they could be limiting their ideas because of fear of blacklash.
