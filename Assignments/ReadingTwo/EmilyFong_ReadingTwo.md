Schmieg talks about digital labor and where do humans fit in if artificial intelligence is the future. The reading was an interview style question and answer between Clara Herrmann and Schmieg. His answers are his thoughts on how to tackle a trivial topic in the tech industry as the web grows. One of the things he talks about was how digital workers are like software extensions. It was an interesting thought to me because becoming a software extension removes the human aspect. Digital workers do not need to be human because computers optimize for efficiency. It seems like a depressing scope of the industry as work can become harder to obtain. Online platforms make workers to easily be recycled and discarded. Digital work can be defined as anything involving contact with a machine. Updating your social media on your phone falls under the category. I agree with him on how any work we do online is some form of digital labor. Even when we are consuming media, we are putting in effort to consume it. It is no wonder that social media has become the main source to consume media. Businesses are willing to pay people to grow their followers or write fake reviews to boost their presence on the internet. Online platforms do offer another avenue for income for freelancers, but it's exploitive. The market is competitive and people are willing to do labor for cheap if it means landing a gig.

Artificial intelligence has been around for awhile. Everything could be automated, but right now outsourcing is popular. It was an good point when Schmieg mentions that people have to pretend to be bots because bots are not good enough. I do feel that humans can make decisions in some morally difficult situations better than an algorithmn. Also, creativity cannot be authentic in a AI. They will be programmed on a set of instructions to create art, but it will never be authentic. He makes a point that we have to be skeptical towards technological progress. Media outlets try to scare people into thinking that automation and AI will replace their jobs. We should not fail to address that there are attributes that humans can do and bots cannot.
