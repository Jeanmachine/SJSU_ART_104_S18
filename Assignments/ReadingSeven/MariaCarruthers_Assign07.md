In the article called Politics-Representation by Hito Steyerl and Marvin Jordan is about “the militarization of social media to the 
corporatization of the world.” Hito Steyerl makes an interesting uncovering about smartphone camera technology she states “ You don’t 
really photograph the present, as the past is woven into it.” The saying says a lot to me because as a human we all grow from our past, 
and we develop into who we are today. The technology that a camera has is extremely interesting because for the camera to have a photo 
that is clear and not pixelated is from what your phone already knows about you and the pictures you have already taken.  Your camera 
will take the information of the old photos that you have taken from the past and photos of what your friends and family have sent you, 
to develop the picture you have taken at the moment. It will scan all the faces and similarity that it sees in your saved information 
and develops what it thinks you might want to see now. This type of technology is highly advance, and a bit creepy knowing that your 
phone is developing something from past information it has stored. The results can even come up not existing in reality but what the 
phone thinks you want to see. Now our phones are predicting what we want. 

Another technology that tends to creep me out is Twitter bots. Twitter bots are supposed to pretend to be humans on the internet as 
they use hashtags and photos of people to make you think they are that person. They will even use quotes from famous philosophers and 
movies to make it more difficult for the person to identify that it is a machine making the posts. Bots have also become political 
armies as well, and they are known to come out of Mexico, Syria, Russia, and Turkey. These countries have the most bots out there 
controlling what is being tweeted on the web; it said to have around eighteen thousand fake twitter accounts. Doing this should not 
be allowed on the internet because it false advertising to get someone seeing the public eye.  Twitter should be trying to put a stop 
to fake accounts used by anybody, especially bots. Even though I disagree with bots using twitter accounts I also understand why it has 
become a popular thing online, it just takes away the credibility of an actual person, and it could jeopardize somebody’s life if it 
wanted too. Technology is starting to become that tool that was once useful but now turning into a threat in some cases.
